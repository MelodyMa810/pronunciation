  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Pronunciation accuracy is low. The presence of only L* and !H* pitch accents suggests a lack of appropriate emphasis on content words and deviation from typical English pronunciation patterns.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Fluency is moderate. The consistent use of break indices '1', '2', '3', and '4' indicates an attempt to segment the speech, but the high frequency of '1' breaks, and the use of '3' before a '4' at 13.04 and 13.3 respectively are uncommon, suggesting potential unnatural pauses or phrasing.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Prosody is poor. The monotonous use of mostly L* accents and L-L% boundary tones indicates a lack of pitch variation and intonational phrasing, failing to convey appropriate emotional or communicative intent.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The ToBI annotation reveals significant issues in several areas. The almost exclusive use of L* pitch accents on stressed syllables (e.g., at 1.935, 2.179, 2.865, etc.) indicates an unnatural flatness, as English typically utilizes H* or H+!H* accents on important words. The presence of only a few H* accents (3.465, seemingly out of place at time 0) and H+L* is a major issue.  The consistent L-L% boundary tones (e.g., at 4.26, 8.39, 13.3) at the end of phrases suggest a lack of variability and emphasis. The use of !H* at 11.925 and 15.945, while a valid accent, in the context of largely L* accents is odd and possibly mislabeled. The break indices, particularly the frequent '1' and the sequence '3' followed by '4' at 13.04 and 13.3, show unusual pauses and phrasing. The lack of H* or other rising accents results in a monotone and unnatural prosody.\"\n}\n```"
