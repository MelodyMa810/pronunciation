Also, a series of L-L% at 6.93, 8.32, and 8.68 is not natural.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 1, \"comment\": \"The breaks are too frequent, with '1' breaks very close together around the 3 second mark, indicating a non-fluent speech pattern. Multiple level 4 breaks are grouped together at the end, implying disfluency.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 1, \"comment\": \"The prosody is poor due to unnatural tone placement, multiple closely spaced L-L% boundary tones, and frequent breaks disrupting the natural flow.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid shows several issues. The tone tier contains a lone L* tone at time 0, which indicates that the transcriber did not properly segment and label the speech. The series of '1' breaks at approximately 3.03, 3.29, and 3.54 seconds suggests unnatural pauses within a phrase. There are several L-L% boundary tones (6.93, 8.32, 8.68) closely spaced. While multiple phrases in succession can end with L-L%, it is unusual for them to be so tightly clustered and indicates segmented and disfluent speech. Finally, a single H* L* sequence from 3.08 to 3.355 cannot fully convey English prosody.\"\n}\n```"
