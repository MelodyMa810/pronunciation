  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Significant inaccuracies detected in the ToBI labeling.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Phrasing and pauses seem unnatural and frequent.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The intonation patterns and emphasis appear misplaced and inconsistent.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"Accuracy: There are multiple instances of `H*` mid-utterance without any clear justification. `L+H*` and `H*+L` are used without a clear pattern. Additionally, `LH-` is used which is not a valid boundary tone. These incorrect assignments suggest poor accuracy. Fluency: The abundance of '1' breaks within phrases, coupled with frequent '4' breaks, disrupt the natural flow of speech. Many of the '1' breaks are at odd places within words or short phrases which is unusual and reduces fluency. Prosody: The prosody is negatively impacted by both the tone and break tiers. The frequent boundary tones, such as `L-L%` and `L-H%`, create a choppy effect and don't align with natural speech patterns. The unnatural pauses suggested by the break tier further disrupt the prosody, creating a monotone and disjointed delivery.\"\n}\n```"
