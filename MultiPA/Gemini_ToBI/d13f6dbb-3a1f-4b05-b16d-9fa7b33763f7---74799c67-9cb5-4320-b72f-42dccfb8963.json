While some pausing is natural, the consistent presence suggests it is somewhat halting, especially considering the long utterances between '4' breaks\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Inappropriate use of `!H*` and `L+H*` indicate issues with proper emphasis, making prosody unnatural.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The textgrid shows several concerning patterns in the prosodic structure. The most glaring is the repeated use of `L-L%` boundary tones at multiple points (0.4, 1.98, 2.39, 5.1, 6.34, 7.84, 8.55, 9.36, 10.82). `L-L%` is typical of declarative utterances, so if there are different sentence types mixed in there, it's misapplied. More specifically, the occurrence of `!H*` at 1.815 and 9.93 indicates a downstepped high pitch accent, suggesting emphasis on unexpected words. Then there's the `L+H*` at 5.75, which is used to highlight the contrastive tone. All of this implies that the speaker either misinterprets the correct prosodic structure of the utterances or is applying emphasis in an unnatural way. The frequent appearance of break indices '1' and '2', which indicate minor pauses, between the longer utterances marked with '4' also suggests the speech may not be fluid. The break index, in combination with the frequent usage of `L-L%` suggest lack of awareness on how to create a natural flow in the speech.\"\n}\n```"
