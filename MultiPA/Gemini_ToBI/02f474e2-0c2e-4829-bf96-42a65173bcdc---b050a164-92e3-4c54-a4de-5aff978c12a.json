  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 1, \"comment\": \"The transcript is nonsensical. Many words are accented with a low tone when a high tone would be expected (e.g., at the end of intonational phrases) and vice versa. The frequent use of !H* is misused, and the boundary tones are haphazardly placed.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 1, \"comment\": \"Based solely on the break index tier, the speech is highly disfluent, with far too many breaks (indicated by '1', '2', and '3') within what should be single words or phrases. These breaks disrupt any sense of natural flow.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 1, \"comment\": \"The prosody is very unnatural. The inconsistent use of pitch accents and boundary tones suggests a lack of a coherent intonational pattern. The frequent L-L% placement also seems strange.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid shows a severe mismatch between expected ToBI patterns and the provided labels. The 'tones' tier contains numerous errors. For example, words that should carry a high pitch accent (H*) often have low pitch accents (L*). Also, the placement of boundary tones (L-L%, H-L%) appears random, often occurring mid-phrase instead of at the end of intonational phrases. \\n\\nThe break index ('breaks' tier) indicates a highly fragmented utterance with far too many breaks. Natural speech has fewer pauses and hesitations than represented. The high number of '1' breaks implies a staccato-like delivery, interrupting what should be continuous words. The '1' break at 0.98, 1.13 and 1.35 for example, make no sense.\\n\\nThe presence of numerous !H* accents seems misplaced. !H* indicates downstep, which is used to mark contrastive accents within a phrase, not with the frequency shown in this grid. The prosody score would therefore be poor.\"\n}\n```"
