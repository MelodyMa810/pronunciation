The rhythm appears to be somewhat choppy.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The prosody is inaccurate. There is a lack of consistent and appropriate intonational phrasing and pitch accent placement.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid indicates several issues. First, there is a high number of 'L*' tones, many marked with time 0. This is suspicious, and if they are valid, the speaker is likely speaking in a monotone. \\n\\nSecond, the inconsistent use of phrase accents and boundary tones, and the presence of unexpected '!'H*' tones suggest problems with intonational phrasing and prominence marking. The consistent use of 'L-L%' indicates many statements with flat final intonation; however the breaks indices do not always align with the flat utterances ('4' break index does indicate a sentence finality, it is placed elsewhere too).\\n\\nThird, the frequent '1' break indices suggest many short pauses, which hinder fluency. The long duration between break indices 15-20 indicates that some parts are fluent, but others are not.\"\n}\n```"
