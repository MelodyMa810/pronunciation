The frequent use of L-L% could be appropriate for statements but may lack the variation expected in natural speech.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The presence of `!H*` at 0.285s suggests an unusual or incorrect pitch accent on a stressed syllable; typically, H* or L* are expected. There are L* tones indicated, followed in close proximity by L-L% at multiple points. The LL- at 6.72 also indicates a mispronounced lexical tone. The frequent use of '4' break indices suggests a complete intonational phrase boundary, which is more frequent than may be typical for natural speech. The H-L% is not typical. Overall there are clear inconsistencies in the assigned tones.\"\n}\n```"
