The presence of L* and H* pitch accents are normal. L-L% boundary tones are frequently used. However, the frequent occurrence of level 4 breaks (4) suggests unnatural pausing. The presence of !H* (downstepped H*) at 6.435, 6.98, 11.735 indicates possible disfluencies or emphatic stress placed inappropriately, drawing attention to the syllable.  The breaks tier indicates phrasal boundaries, and their distribution, especially with the presence of !H*, is key to assessing fluency.\"\n}\n```"
