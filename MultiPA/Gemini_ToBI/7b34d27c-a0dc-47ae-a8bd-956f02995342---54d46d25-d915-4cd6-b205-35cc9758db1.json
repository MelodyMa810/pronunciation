However, the break indices are not always placed at natural sentence boundaries or phrase boundaries. \"\n  },\n  \"Prosody\": {\n    \"score\": 2,\n    \"comment\": \"Prosody is weak. There's a lack of appropriate pitch variation and prominence placement, with dominant Low boundary tones. This suggests the speaker is not effectively conveying emphasis or intonational phrasing.\"\n  },\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid reveals several issues with English pronunciation.  The 'tones' tier shows a prevalence of 'L*' and boundary tones such as L-L%. L* is often used on stressed syllables but there are very few H* tones, indicating the speaker is not using adequate pitch accents to mark emphasis, thus making the utterance sound monotone.  The presence of 'H*+L' at 0.655 is a start, but there aren't enough of those. The 'breaks' tier mostly contains break index '1', suggesting very short pauses within phrases, potentially disrupting natural phrasing. While breaks of index '3' and '4' exist at 4.42, 5.62, 6.72, 8.75 and 9.4, the prosodic phrasing is off. Most boundary tones are L-L% which indicates ending phrases and sentences with a low pitch. HL- boundary tone exists at 10.92 but there's no clear phrasing with high pitch marking important words or parts of the sentence.\"\n}\n```"
