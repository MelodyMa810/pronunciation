Break indices of 3 and 4 are used reasonably, indicating pauses.\"\n  },\n  \"Prosody\": {\n    \"score\": 2,\n    \"comment\": \"The prosody is inaccurate due to mislabeled tones and inappropriate phrasing. The use of question marks where there are not any questions and lack of emphasis on some words where it should be leads to prosody errors.\"\n  },\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid exhibits several issues that negatively impact the pronunciation assessment. \\n\\n*   **Tonal errors:** The frequent use of `L-L%` at the beginning of utterances (e.g., at 0.26, 0.59 seconds) is unusual unless these are extremely de-emphasized phrases or very low declarative sentence endings. There are not many `H-H%` sentence endings which mark emphasis or a high tone which is indicative of a question. The prominence markers (H*, L*) appear misplaced. For example, the sequences with many `L*` marks, such as the section around 9.3 and 9.6 seconds is unusual in most english spoken prompts. Furthermore, it seems like `!H*` is used in arbitrary places, indicating that it is either being overused, or is only ever used for emphasis, which isn't typical, but could be correct if this is a very emotionally charged statement. \\n*   **Phrasing inconsistencies:** While the break indices (1-4) indicate an attempt at phrasing, the relationship between these breaks and the tone markings is not always clear or logical. In general, the tone markings don't clearly connect with the breaks in the breaks tier. \\n*   **Missing or Incorrect Tone Marks:** The absence of expected pitch accents and boundary tones suggests either a monotone delivery or incorrect labeling. The mix of `H*+L` and `H-L%` at the end does not sound as natural with the break indices shown, because they are both typically used at the end of sentences, while the break indices (4) show that they are not the end of sentences. \"\n}\n```"
