The very frequent use of H*+L pitch accents (at 0.455, 1.23, 2.44, 2.84, 4.305) is not typical for a standard English utterance. The presence of HL- (1.71) is also an odd placement. There are a number of phrase boundaries marked as '4' (1.71, 3.11, 4.67, 6.76, 9.78, 11.66), which indicates major intonational phrase boundaries. The numerous level 1 breaks ('1') throughout the utterance might chop the phrasing excessively. The 'L-L%' boundary tones (6.76, 9.78) are present, which often signal the end of a declarative utterance, but their placement might be inconsistent with typical sentence structure. The presence of '!H*' at 10.969999999999999 suggests a downstepped high pitch accent which has not been evaluated without the corresponding sound. There is a missing tone at 11.21.\"\n}\n```"
