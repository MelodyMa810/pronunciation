  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"There are several instances where the pitch accents and boundary tones do not seem appropriate for standard English pronunciation, affecting the overall accuracy.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"The presence of multiple break indices of '4' suggests pauses and phrase boundaries are recognized, but the content and tones do not match usual English intonation.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The prosody is not natural sounding, as the tonal patterns seem misplaced or overemphasized.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid contains both tonal markings and break indices. However, the appropriateness of the application of the tones and breaks to speech is questionable. \\n\\nThe frequent use of 'L-L%' as a boundary tone suggests a consistent falling intonation, which might be accurate for statements but not appropriate if questions or other intonational phrases are present. The high number of '4' breaks indicates phrase boundaries, which can contribute to fluency if placed correctly. \\n\\nThe use of '!H*' indicates a downstepped high tone, which is present at multiple points. The use of 'H*' is also present at 7.775 and 11.645. If the speech is question or statement, such tones are often associated with certain words. However, without the text of the audio, it is impossible to assert if its use is accurate in context.\\n\\nSpecific examples of questionable prosody include: the sequence 'L-L%' and break '4' at 0.71, 2.68, 3.76, 4.81, 5.72, 8.82, 10.23, 12.07, and 12.93. These may not correspond appropriately to the natural prosodic phrasing, which depends on sentence type (statement, question, etc.). Further, the break indices '1' might mean something, but without further details, it is hard to evaluate its appropriateness in this instance.\"\n}\n```"
