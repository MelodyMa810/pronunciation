The presence of multiple L* pitch accents without corresponding H* accents suggests a monotone delivery in many parts. The frequent use of L-L% boundary tones marks the end of intonational phrases, but their placement doesn't always align with natural phrasing, potentially leading to unnatural pauses. The use of !H* (downstepped H*) is present, but the context isn't clear. Break indices of '1' and '2' are frequent, suggesting short pauses within phrases, while '3' and '4' indicate longer pauses at phrase and intonational phrase boundaries, respectively. However, inconsistencies between the break indices and the tonal markers exist. For example, there are '4' breaks without a preceding H* or L* pitch accent at times. The LL- at the end indicates a sentence finality. The presence of H*+L in multiple locations should indicate question intonation, but if this is not correct, is an error.\"\n}\n```"
