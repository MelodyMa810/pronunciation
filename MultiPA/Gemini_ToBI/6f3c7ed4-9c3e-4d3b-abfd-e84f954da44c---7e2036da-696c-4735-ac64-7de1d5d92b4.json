  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The frequent use of L-L% at phrase boundaries and H*+L pitch accents seems inappropriate for general English speech, possibly indicating misapplication of ToBI conventions or non-native accent issues.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Fluency is moderate, with numerous breaks (labeled '1','2', and '4') throughout the utterance. While some breaks are natural, their high frequency suggests hesitation or unnatural pausing.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Prosody is weak. The repetitive use of L-L% boundaries, alongside the H*+L pitch accents and inconsistencies such as the initial H* at time 0, demonstrate a limited range and possible misplacement of emphasis.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid reveals several potential issues with pronunciation. First, the accuracy is questionable due to unusual ToBI markings. The prevalence of 'L-L%' boundaries (at times 1.2, 1.81, 3.24, 4.2, 4.67, 5.2, 7.06, 9.83, and 11.02) suggests a forced or unnatural intonation pattern, as 'L-L%' is typically reserved for declarative sentence endings or major phrase boundaries. Their presence throughout the utterance is atypical. Furthermore, the use of 'H*+L' pitch accents (at times 0.735, 2.285, 7.555, and 8.135) is less common and possibly applied incorrectly. The Fluency is affected by the numerous breaks marked as '1','2', and '4' indicating pauses and possible disfluencies. The prosody appears monotone and unnatural, largely due to the aforementioned inappropriate placement of boundary tones. The initial \\\"H*\\\" at time 0 also seems out of place, suggesting a potential error in marking the speech from the start.\"\n}\n```"
