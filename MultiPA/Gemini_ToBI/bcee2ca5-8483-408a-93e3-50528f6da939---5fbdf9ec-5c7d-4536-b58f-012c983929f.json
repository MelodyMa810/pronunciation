The variety of break indices is also important. However, the somewhat random placement of them suggests some issues still.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The prosody seems rather unnatural. There are several high boundary tones (L-H%) and exclamation points (!H*).\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The accuracy score is low because there are a number of strange labels. For example, the label L* at time 0. It is highly unlikely a low tone is present at the very start of an utterance. The label 'LL-' is also not one that's normally used. !H* is also rarely used, especially in running speech. Moreover, a variety of L-L%, L-H% suggests the speaker is using a variety of intonation patterns, which may not be the case.\\n\\nThe break indices are used fairly appropriately, which suggests some awareness of how the speech should be phrased, but there is some odd choices, like a '1' break index at 10.27. The use of '4' break index at 0.99, 2.05, 5.83, 7.9, 8.38, 10.35, 10.72, 11.06, 11.88, 12.37, and 13.76 makes the speech very choppy. \\n\\nThe prosody score is low, as the intonational phrasing seems unnatural, such as the use of the exclamation mark (!H*).\"\n}\n```"
