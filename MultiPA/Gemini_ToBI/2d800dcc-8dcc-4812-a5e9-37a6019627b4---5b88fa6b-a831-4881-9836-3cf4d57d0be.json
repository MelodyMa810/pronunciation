There are many ToBI labels present, suggesting the transcriber heard some clear patterns, however the frequency of L-L% boundaries and lack of H-H% suggest something unusual. Without the audio, it is impossible to confirm\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Fluency is moderate. The presence of break indices between 1 and 4 shows some variation in pausing, but a better fluency would show longer runs without breaks and more natural phrasing.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Prosody seems unnatural. While there are pitch accents (H*), the frequent use of L-L% boundaries suggests a monotonous or unusually punctuated speech pattern. A more natural prosody would exhibit greater variation and strategic placement of pitch accents.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid indicates several potential issues: \\n\\n*   **Frequent L-L% boundaries:** These phrase final boundaries are pervasive throughout the utterance (1.33, 2.13, 3.98, 5.87, 6.75, 8.52, 10.62, 11.85). Natural speech does not usually have so many of these short clauses one after another. This suggests either very short, choppy phrases or an unusual speaking style.\\n*   **Limited High Boundaries:** H-H% boundaries are missing entirely which indicates a lack of rising intonation typical of continuation rises, questions or related speech actions. \\n*   **Varied Break Indices:** Break indices (1-4) show some variation in phrasing, with '4' indicating major phrase boundaries and '1' indicating weak boundaries. However, the meaning of these breaks is affected by the unusual tonal annotations.\\n*   **Pitch Accent placement**: pitch accents (H*) are present (2.985, 4.73), though it is difficult to assess the appropriateness without knowing what words they align to. The use of !H* may also indicate unnatural phrasing.\"\n}\n```"
