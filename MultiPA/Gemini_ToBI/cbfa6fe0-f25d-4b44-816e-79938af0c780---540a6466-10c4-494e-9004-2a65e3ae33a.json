The presence of 'H*+L' at time 0 is highly unusual and likely incorrect. Other tone placements are suspect.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Fluency is moderate, based on the presence of various break indices. The speaker pauses frequently, which impacts the overall flow. But there are multiple short breaks\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Prosody is limited and somewhat unnatural, due to the inappropriate/unexpected use of pitch accents and boundary tones. The overall intonational contour seems forced and potentially inaccurate.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The ToBI labeling exhibits several issues that negatively impact the overall assessment. The presence of 'H*+L' at time 0.0 is highly unusual for English prosody and suggests either a mislabeling or a highly unusual utterance start. The frequent use of 'L-L%' boundaries contributes to a choppy and potentially unnatural rhythm. The '!H*' accents at 2.73 and 6.25 indicate emphasized syllables, but without context, it's impossible to verify if these placements are appropriate. Break indices ('1', '2', '3', '4') are present, suggesting some phrasing, but their placement in conjunction with the tone markers creates an unnatural feel. The 'LL-' marker at 10.84 is another point of concern, as this is an unusual label. The final 'L-H%' seems incorrect.\"\n}\n```"
