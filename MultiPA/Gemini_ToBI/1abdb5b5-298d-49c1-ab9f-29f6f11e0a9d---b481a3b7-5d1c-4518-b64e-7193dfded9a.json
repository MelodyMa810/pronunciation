The frequent use of '!H*' (downstepped high tone) is suspicious and likely inaccurate. This occurs at 2.445, 4.995, 6.605, 8.559999999999999, 10.120000000000001, and multiple other times including at zero, implying it's being applied generically and likely incorrectly. Such high frequency of downstep is atypical. Phrase boundary tones appear inappropriately placed. For example, 'H-L%' at 3.97, and 'L-L%' at 5.86 may not be correct for English sentence structure given the breaks annotation. The break indices alone are not enough to determine what the phrase/intonation is but it seems doubtful that 'H-L%' would be after single words or small phrases with Break Index = 4. Additionally, H*+L at 9.379999999999999 is present without any information of the underlying meaning, so it is hard to say if this is placed correctly. L+H* at 15.59 may not be correct given L-H% immediately follows at 15.85 and is not typical prosodic phrasing. The inconsistent marking overall suggests a lack of understanding of English intonational phonology.\"\n}\n```"
