  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Pronunciation accuracy is low. The number of tone markers and breaks suggests an attempt at intonation, but the use of a wide range of pitch accents might not align well with standard English pronunciation, leading to mispronounced words or sounds.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Fluency is poor. The frequent break indices, predominantly level 1, indicates numerous short pauses which disrupt the flow of speech.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Prosody is somewhat unnatural. While pitch accents are present, their distribution and types might not reflect typical English intonation patterns. The presence of boundary tones indicates an attempt to mark phrase endings, but the overall effect is likely forced or unnatural.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid shows a complex set of ToBI annotations, but several patterns suggest pronunciation issues. Firstly, the density of break indices labeled as '1' indicates frequent, short pauses that impede fluency. Secondly, the use of a variety of pitch accents such as 'L+H*', '!H*', 'H*+L' may not correspond to appropriate stressed syllables within words, and may not align with expected English intonation contours. The boundary tones ('L-L%', 'L-H%', 'HL-') are present, indicating attention to phrasing, but the odd combination and placement might not align with standard English prosody. Specifically, the presence of a 'L-H%' question contour at 9.58 seconds is not followed by a question intonation, which is more typically realized as H-H% in questions. The combination of 'LL-' and 'H*+L' at around 6.8 seconds seems unnatural and incorrect. Overall, the annotation indicates a focus on marking the speech, but the resultant speech may sound disfluent, inaccurate and unnatural.\"\n}\n```"
