For example, multiple instances of \\\"H*+L\\\" are used within what appears to be a single phrase (e.g., around 1.9 and 2.19 seconds), which is not typical for English. The presence of \\\"!H*\\\" at time 0 indicates a downstepped high pitch, and it seems out of place without a prior high tone. The overuse of L-H% and L-L% (4 total) within the speech segment seems atypical, indicating a potential misunderstanding of intonational phrasing. Also, there are \\\"L*\\\" labels applied very frequently (more than 10 times), suggesting an unusual monotone-like speech pattern. The \\\"LL-\\\" at the end is also an unexpected marker.\"\n}\n```"
