  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Many of the pitch accents and boundary tones appear misplaced, suggesting inaccurate alignment or incorrect ToBI labeling.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The presence of frequent level 1 breaks and misplaced level 4 breaks interrupts natural speech flow.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The prosody is not natural, due to the inconsistent use of pitch accents and boundary tones.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"Accuracy and fluency are low.  Numerous '1' breaks appear between words (e.g., 0.76, 1.44, 2.05, 2.39, 2.61) which would not occur in fluent speech. Additionally, some phrase boundaries marked with '4' (e.g., 3.4, 4.05) seem either too frequent or misplaced. The prosody suffers from errors such as inconsistent pitch accent usage (L*+H at 0.845, H*+L at 2.21, HL- at 6.48) and questionable placement. The presence of !H* at 5.93 and 12.35 would imply downstep, but these appear isolated. There is also a case of HL- at 6.48 and H-L% at 7.86 boundary tones that are not common. The sheer density of ToBI labels also suggests over-analysis and a potentially incorrect application of the ToBI system, further impacting the evaluation of accuracy, fluency, and prosody.\"\n}\n```"
