Given the limited context and isolated ToBI labels, it is hard to judge accuracy of the sounds themselves but assuming the tones are close to correct, the sounds should be somewhat correct. No attempt to mark the whole utterance is made, only small parts.\"\n  },\n  \"Fluency\": {\n    \"score\": 2,\n    \"comment\": \"The presence of break indices (1 and 4) suggests some awareness of phrasing, but the lack of phrasal tones covering entire phrases and longer pauses reduces the flow. The breaks don't seem to coincide with phrase endings. It is not possible to determine fluency without the orthographic transcription.\"\n  },\n  \"Prosody\": {\n    \"score\": 3,\n    \"comment\": \"The speaker attempts some prosodic variation by using different boundary tones like L-L% and H-L%, and pitch accents like H* and H*+L. The prosody may or may not be correct without the context.\"\n  },\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid contains tones and break indices. H*, H*+L, H-L%, and L-L% are marked, indicating some intention to represent pitch accents and boundary tones. Break indices 1 and 4 mark boundaries between words and phrases. However, the scarcity of tones/breaks makes it hard to assess the overall pronunciation. The lack of the orthographic transcription, along with the limited context makes determining the accuracy and fluency difficult. No attempt is made to mark the whole utterance. All tones appear early in the timeline. There is a long gap with no notation after 11.2 seconds. Based on the timestamps of tones and breaks, the utterance may only consist of the first 11.2 seconds.\"\n}\n```"
