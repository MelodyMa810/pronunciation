  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Pronunciation appears to be inaccurate, potentially missing stress in appropriate locations.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Fluency is somewhat interrupted by the pauses and seemingly random lengths of segments.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Prosody is lacking, with intonation not effectively conveying meaning or emotion.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The ToBI labels suggest several issues. The frequent use of `L*` tone and the presence of `!H*` indicate misapplication of stress/accent. The excessive number of breaks marked as '1' interspersed throughout indicates unnatural pauses within words or phrases. The use of boundary tones such as `L-L%` and `L-H%` seems misplaced, as they appear frequently, not just at the end of intonational phrases, further disrupting the natural flow. It's difficult to properly assess the complete prosody due to the absence of orthographic text; however, based on the given ToBI markers, it suggests a lack of appropriate pitch movements and prominence assignments. The presence of \\\"LL-\\\" is not a standard ToBI label and suggests there is an error in annotation or transcription. A high amount of breaks of level 1, combined with the overuse of L* tones denotes a monotonous rythm. `L*+H` at 16.775 could indicate an attempt to mark pitch accent but without knowing the actual text, it's difficult to say for certain.\"\n}\n```"
