Some phrases seem rushed while others are unnaturally drawn out.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The prosody is unnatural, indicated by the overuse of L-L% phrase boundaries and the presence of !H* tones which sound odd in this context.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The presence of 'H*' and 'L*' markers at time 0 is questionable and indicates incorrect assignment, since tones should be associated with specific words or syllables. The frequent use of 'L-L%' boundaries (at 0.83, 1.95, 4.11, 5.43, 6.5, 7.9, 9.09, 10.75) suggests that the speaker is using an excessive number of intonational phrases, which may sound unnatural. Also the use of downstepped H* (!H*) at 5.83, 8.305, and 9.71, while not inherently wrong, seem misplaced within the given intonational phrasing. The break indices (1-4) seem arbitrarily placed, indicating the speaker may have an unnatural rhythm when speaking.\"\n}\n```"
