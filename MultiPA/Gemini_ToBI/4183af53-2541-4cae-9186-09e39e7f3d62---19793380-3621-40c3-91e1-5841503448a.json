Certain accents like !H* are randomly used.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The `tones` tier contains many errors. For example, `H*+L` is not a standard accent in English ToBI. The repeated use of `!H*` without any apparent discourse reason suggests inaccurate labeling, as it is a downstepped high accent. Similarly, the arbitrary sequence of `HL-` followed by `L*+H` at 3.24 and 3.415 is very unusual. Also, there are multiple L-L% sequences which typically are longer phrase boundaries placed at times that should be shorter pauses (break index '4'). The combination H-L% followed by L-H% at 12.17 and 13.12 is unlikely. Break indices show frequent and short pauses with index '1' suggesting disfluency. '4' at 1.28 followed by multiple '1's indicate potentially unnatural phrasing at the start.\"\n}\n```"
