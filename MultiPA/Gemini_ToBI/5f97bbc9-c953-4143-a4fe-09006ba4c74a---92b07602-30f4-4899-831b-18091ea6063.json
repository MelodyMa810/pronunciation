The presence of mostly low tones (L*, L-L%) and limited use of high tones (H*, !H*) indicate a monotone or downward-drifting intonation.\"\n  },\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid shows a speaker who frequently uses L* pitch accents, without consistent H* alignments. This suggests a limited pitch range and potentially monotone delivery. The frequent use of L-L% boundary tones indicates that many phrases are ending in low pitch, possibly resulting in a lack of emphasis and a 'sagging' intonation pattern. The presence of !H* suggests attempts at contrastive stress, but this is not consistently carried through the entire utterance. The break indices ('breaks') indicate relatively short pauses ('1' breaks) within phrases and longer pauses ('4' breaks) at the ends of utterances. However, the large amount of break index '1's suggests the the speaker has problems with flow. The final `HL-` at 15.85 indicates a complex tonal gesture to mark a phrase boundary.\"\n}\n```"
