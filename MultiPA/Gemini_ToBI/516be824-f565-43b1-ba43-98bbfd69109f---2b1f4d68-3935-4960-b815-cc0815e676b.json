The placement of L+H* at 0, and again at 4.835, and H*+L at 5.655 are questionable without the actual transcribed text. \\n*   **Boundary Tones**: The use of L-L% at 0.54 and 11.44 suggests intonational phrase boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the L-H% boundary tones at 3.86 and 6.62 are also present, which may indicate questions or continuations, depending on context.  The use of HL- at 12.38 needs context for evaluation. \\n*   **Break Indices**: The inconsistent break indices (1, 2, 3, 4) indicate varying degrees of pausing. Breaks of '4' usually coincide with intonational phrase boundaries. The pattern of 1s suggests potential underspeaking/lack of phrase definition within utterances, while other breaks (like 2 and 3) could be appropriate depending on syntactic and semantic factors.\\n* **Unusual use of LL-**: The occurrence of LL- at 6.01 is an unconventional notation, implying a extremely low fall at a phrase boundary which may be a mistake or a very marked intonation. \\n* **Misplaced !H***: The placement of !H* at 10.49 seems out of place, typically !H* occurs on stressed syllables that have been deaccented, and without text, it is difficult to tell if it fits.\"\n}\n```"
