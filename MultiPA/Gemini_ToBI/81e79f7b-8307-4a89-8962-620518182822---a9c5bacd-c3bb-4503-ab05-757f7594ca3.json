  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Limited accuracy due to potential over-use of L* and presence of LL- tone, indicating monotone or unnatural pitch.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Mostly appropriate break indices (1-4) are present, suggesting decent phrasal grouping. However, many 1 breaks may signal unnatural pauses.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Prosody is weak due to reliance on L* and L-L% boundaries, resulting in flatness. L*+H is only present once. L-H% is present, but the overall pattern is monotone.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid shows frequent L* tones (0.255, 1.045, 1.77, 4.805, 9.059999999999999) and L-L% boundaries (7.07, 7.95, 9.83, 10.42). This suggests a somewhat flat or monotone intonation pattern. The phrase breaks generally align with prosodic boundaries, as indicated by the break indices (1-4). However, frequent '1' breaks between the '4' breaks (0.51, 0.91, 1.09, 1.52, 2.03, 3.47, 8.52, 8.58, 9.17) could indicate choppy phrasing or unnatural pauses. The presence of LL- (4.68) suggests potential lengthening. The use of L*+H (2.27) and L-H% (2.93, 5.74, 8.96) demonstrates some pitch movement, but the overall prosodic contour is dominated by low tones and final falls, signaling a lack of overall variation.\"\n}\n```"
