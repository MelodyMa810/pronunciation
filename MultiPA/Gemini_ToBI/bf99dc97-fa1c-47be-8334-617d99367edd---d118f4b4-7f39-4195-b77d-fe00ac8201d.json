Frequent use of '4' breaks indicates major pauses between words and phrases, disrupting the natural flow. The repetitive use of 'L-L%' boundaries (at 1.2, 4.08, 7.92, 9.18, 10.53, 13.41, 14.03, 15.84) suggest finality or the end of a thought group far too often, even mid-sentence. The pitch accents (*H*, *L*, !H*) appear inconsistent and lack a clear pattern, leading to poor emphasis. The presence of LL- at 6.37 and 16.6 suggests low boundary tones potentially at inappropriate places.\"\n}\n```"
