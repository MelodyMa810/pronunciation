  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Numerous low tones (L*) are present, even on stressed syllables. This indicates potential issues with the realization of pitch accents. The presence of !H* also suggests misplacement of high targets.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"The presence of breaks (1, 2, 3, 4) indicates pauses, with level 4 being the longest pause, level 1 being the shortest. The fluency is affected by these breaks.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The prosody seems unnatural, with a lack of appropriate pitch accenting and intonational phrasing. There is inconsistent use of L* and !H*, and L-L% is frequently used at the end of phrases, which, while marking boundaries, may not always be appropriate.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid reveals several issues regarding English pronunciation. Primarily, the extensive use of L* tones suggests a flat or monotone delivery and misapplication of pitch accents. For example, sequences of L* across multiple words or syllables indicate a lack of prominence on stressed syllables. While the breaks tier shows pauses of varying lengths, the intonational tier suggests that the intonation is not used correctly with the breaks to communicate meaning. The frequent occurrence of L-L% indicates consistent phrase-final lowering, but this can become monotonous if overused. The presence of !H* tones suggests an attempt at downstepping, but their placement appears to be somewhat erratic and may be incorrectly timed relative to the accented syllables. The LL- mark around 7.73 suggests a final fall, which is appropriate, but the other markings make the overall prosody hard to understand.\"\n}\n```"
