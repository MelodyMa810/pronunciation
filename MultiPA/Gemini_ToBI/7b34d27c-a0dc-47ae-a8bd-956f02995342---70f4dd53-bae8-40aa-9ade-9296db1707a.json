The frequent downstepping (!H*) suggests that there might not be a natural rise and fall of intonation. The consistent L-L% at phrase boundaries indicates a statement or continuation intonation but the !H* tones make the overall pattern questionable.\"\n  },\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid contains information about tones and breaks, according to ToBI conventions. The 'tones' tier includes pitch accents (H*, L*), boundary tones (H-L%, L-L%, L-H%), and downstepped tones (!H*). The 'breaks' tier indicates the strength of pauses between words or phrases, with '1' representing a weak break and '4' representing a strong break.\\n\\nAccuracy is low because of the multiple occurrences of \\\"!H*\\\" which denotes a downstepped high tone. Native speakers usually don't downstep on every stressed syllable. Downstepping often indicates a contrastive element, but here it occurs frequently, which is unlikely in natural speech and thus indicative of some degree of mispronunciation.\\n\\nFluency is moderate. The breaks tier shows frequent short pauses ('1'), along with longer ones ('4') which do seem to coincide with boundary tones such as L-L% and H-L% indicating good location of phrases. The numerous level 1 breaks detract from the feeling of naturalness.\\n\\nProsody is weak because the frequent use of !H* tones is not typical. While the L-L% boundary tones at the end of phrases are appropriate for statements or continuation, the lack of intonational variation due to the persistent downstepping makes it sound unnatural. The use of H*+L pitch accents exists, but their effect is undermined by downstepping.\"\n}\n```"
