Some pauses might be misplaced though, impacting naturalness.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"The prosody is unnatural due to the questionable application of pitch accents (primarily L*) and boundary tones. The prominence lending appears unusual, particularly with the lack of H* pitch accents.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid displays several inconsistencies in the application of ToBI markers, indicating potential problems with the pronunciation.  \\n\\n1.  **Pitch Accents:** The heavy reliance on `L*` as the primary pitch accent is highly unusual. In English, `H*` or `L+H*` are much more typical for stressed syllables. The presence of `!H*` accents suggests downstep, but the overall pattern of accents doesn't align with typical English intonation, potentially misplacing emphasis. The text seems to want to highlight certain words, but the L* accents do the opposite.\\n2. **Boundary Tones:** The occurrence of boundary tones like `H-L%` and `L-L%` is correct in principle, but the distribution feels off. For instance, numerous phrases seem to end with low boundary tones `L-L%`. These could signify statements but given the context, the frequency may be inappropriate. A rising boundary tone (e.g., L-H%) would be expected at some question phrases, but its placement in the text is not clear.\\n3. **Break Indices:** The break indices (1-4) indicate the level of juncture between words and phrases. The frequent use of '4' indicates major phrase boundaries, which seems correct. The variety of lower-numbered breaks (1-3) is expected. However, the presence of a '1' break (weakest) between several accented words (based on the L* accents) suggests a lack of appropriate connection between those words in the phrase.\\n4. **LH- at the end** Presence of LH- at end is interesting, normally we would expect H-L%. However without the audio this is difficult to assess.\"\n}\n```"
