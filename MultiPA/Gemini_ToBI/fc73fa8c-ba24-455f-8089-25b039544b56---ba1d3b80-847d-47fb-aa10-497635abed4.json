There are a few expected high tones (H*), but these are overshadowed by the unexpected accents. The LL- boundary tone at the end is also atypical and likely represents a mispronunciation.\"\n  },\n  \"Fluency\": {\n    \"score\": 3,\n    \"comment\": \"Fluency is moderate. The presence of numerous level 1 breaks indicates reasonable phrasing, but the frequent forced downstepping with !H* markers interrupts the natural flow.\"\n  },\n  \"Prosody\": {\n    \"score\": 2,\n    \"comment\": \"Prosody is poor. The overuse of !H* suggests an inappropriate emphasis on many syllables. The overall intonational contour, as indicated by the boundary tones and pitch accents, does not create a natural and communicative sound.  Furthermore, many tones are entered as '0' which makes analysis impossible.\"\n  },\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The analysis reveals several issues. The frequent use of '!H*' throughout the utterance (0.72, 6.945, 7.765, 9.135, 9.475) signifies inappropriate emphatic stress on syllables where it is not expected. The presence of 'H*+L' at 1.1099999999999999 suggests a falling tone on that syllable, which might be appropriate depending on the sentence structure but difficult to assess without the orthographic transcription. Boundary tones of 'L-L%' (0.44, 5.25, 6.41, 8.66, 12.76) are used, which signals the ends of intonational phrases, but its frequency here seems excessive given the presence of several level 1 breaks. The 'LL-' boundary tone at 13.47 is not a standard ToBI label, likely indicating incorrect labeling. The breaks tier contains numbers 1-4 marking break indices. The '4's (0.44, 4.2, 5.25, 6.41, 8.66, 12.76) co-occur with L-L%, as would be expected. However, many entries are coded as '0', such as the tone entries between 9.8 and 12.76, implying there are missing or incorrectly labeled data.\"\n}\n```"
