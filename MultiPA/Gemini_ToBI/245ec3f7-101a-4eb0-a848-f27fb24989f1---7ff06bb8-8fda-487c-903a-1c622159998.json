Many incorrect or missing tones, and erratic phrasing.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 1, \"comment\": \"Choppy and unnatural rhythm due to inconsistent break indices. Pauses are frequent and seemingly random, disrupting the flow.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 1, \"comment\": \"Lack of appropriate intonation and phrasing. The tones and breaks do not contribute to a meaningful or natural-sounding prosodic contour. There are tones at the beginning, with missing ones at the end.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid shows a severely flawed ToBI annotation. \\n\\n*   **Tones:** The tone tier contains many errors: There are H* tones at times 0, 1.335, 1.63. There are L* tones at times 2.12, 3.795, 5.355, 5.789, 6.39, 7.29, 7.845, 9.615. There are !H* tones at times 0.955, 2.465. There are L-L% tones at time 4.57. There is a H*+L tone at time 8.975 and HL- at 9.28. There is a final LL- at the end. The frequency and placement of these tones are not correct.\\n*   **Breaks:** The break indices ('1', '2', '3', '4') are inconsistent and don't align with natural phrasal boundaries. Numerous '1' breaks suggest very short, unnatural pauses within words or phrases. The presence of '3' breaks at times 9.28, 9.73 does not correspond with any finality. The breaks should create phrasing to organize the speech into coherent units, but in this example, they create an uneven and unpredictable rhythm.\\n\\nThe combination of incorrect tone placement and break indices suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of English prosody. The annotations do not reflect the intonational patterns or phrasal structure of natural speech, leading to a very low assessment across all three dimensions.\"\n}\n```"
