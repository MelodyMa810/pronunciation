  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Pronunciation accuracy is low due to the inconsistent and potentially inappropriate use of ToBI markers. Many L-L% boundaries are placed without preceding pitch accents, and the use of !H* is questionable without context.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Fluency is likely disrupted by the unnatural prosodic structure implied by the ToBI markings. The frequent and potentially misplaced phrase breaks (level 4) and intermediate phrase breaks (level 2 and 3) suggest a choppy or stilted delivery.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 1, \"comment\": \"Prosody is very poor. The inconsistent application of pitch accents, the over-use of boundary tones, and the seemingly random placement of break indices all contribute to a very unnatural and likely incomprehensible intonation pattern.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid reveals several issues. First, the frequent use of L-L% (at 4.59, 6.74, 7.67, 9.0, 14.32, 15.14, 16.09, and 17.92) without clear preceding pitch accents (H*, L*, etc.) suggests either incorrect transcription or a highly unusual speaking style. L-L% typically marks the end of an intonational phrase and follows a pitch accent, marking a low boundary tone. The use of break index 4 at these locations reinforces the sense of over-segmentation.  The break indices themselves seem arbitrary, with frequent '4' breaks that don't correspond to any clear intonational phrasing. Furthermore, the use of !H* (at 5.825, 10.004999999999999, and 15.55) suggests a downstepped high pitch accent, but without the preceding context of H* accents to establish the downstepping pattern, it appears out of place. The presence of 'LL-' (at 10.86) is also problematic, since this tag is rarely used, which is usually for very low tones, but its function here is ambiguous. Lastly, the combination of H*+L at 1.225 and 9.629999999999999, together with H-L% at 0.64, 1.55, and 16.9 suggests a question or a contrast, but without the actual text, it's impossible to assess if it is used appropriately. The number of issues suggests significant problems in the prosodic realization, leading to very low scores across all categories.\"\n}\n```"
