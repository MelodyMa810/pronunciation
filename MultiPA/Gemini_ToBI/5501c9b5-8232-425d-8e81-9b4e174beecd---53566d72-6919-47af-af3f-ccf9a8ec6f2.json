  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Inaccurate. The presence of both !H* and LL- tones indicates mispronounced or unnatural prominence and boundary tones, indicating a flawed mapping between text and speech.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Moderate fluency. The consistent presence of break indices (1-4) suggests speech that is segmented into phrases, clauses, and sentences, but not necessarily smooth or effortless.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Poor prosody. The mixture of L*+H, H*, H-L% and L-H% suggest some intonational variation, but !H* indicates an inappropriate prominence, and LL- indicates a broken cadence. The consistent, sometimes seemingly random, use of these features indicates a lack of naturalness.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The analysis relies on the ToBI annotations provided. Accuracy is negatively affected by the presence of !H* (downstepped high tone, indicating misplacement of prominence) at 11.19 and LL- (Low-Low boundary tone, also cadence breaker) at 11.73 and 18.33, which disrupts the natural flow. Fluency receives a slightly higher score due to consistent breaks marked using values from 1-4, indicating at least segmentation of utterances, which contributes to readability. However, the number, type, and distribution of boundary tones, like the high number of L-H% and the cadence breakers, suggest unnatural phrasing and intonation, hence a low score for Prosody. The L*+H tones may indicate some attempt to use pitch accents, but the other problems overshadow this.\"\n}\n```"
