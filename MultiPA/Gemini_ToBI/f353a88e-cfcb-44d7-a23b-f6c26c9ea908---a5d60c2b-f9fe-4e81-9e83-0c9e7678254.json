However, the use of '4' breaks indicates longer pauses at phrase boundaries.\"\n  },\n  \"Prosody\": {\n    \"score\": 2,\n    \"comment\": \"The prosody is unnatural, showing inconsistent and potentially incorrect use of pitch accents and boundary tones. Specifically, the prominence (!H*) at 9.325, 9.399 and 9.495 may not be appropriate for the context, and the lack of other expected high tones or pitch accents reduces the perceived naturalness.\"\n  },\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid shows a limited range of ToBI markers. The frequent use of 'L-L%' boundary tones (2.84, 4.66, 5.32, 6.31, 10.01) suggests a monotonous intonation, lacking the rise-fall contours common in English.  The breaks tier shows many word breaks indicated by '1', as well as '4' for phrase breaks. The use of 'L*' pitch accents (3.5599999999999996, 4.33, 4.574999999999999, 6.859999999999999, 7.195, 9.495000000000001) without corresponding H* accents suggests a flat or falling intonation throughout which is odd. The use of !H* without associated phrasal tones seems incorrect or incomplete. The initial H-L% at 1.22 indicates a high start but not followed up with consistent accentuation within the phrase. Similarly, the L-H% at 2.41 and 5.87 are isolated, which will make the intonation curve feel discontinuous.\"\n}\n```"
