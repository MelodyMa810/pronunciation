  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Mostly accurate, but the presence of !H* consistently suggests potential mispronunciations or emphatic stresses where they might not belong, lowering the overall accuracy score.\"},\n  \"Fluency\": {\"score\": 3, \"comment\": \"Fluency is acceptable, with break indices mostly at level 1, suggesting smooth transitions between words. However, several level 3 and 4 breaks may indicate pauses that disrupt the flow at times.\"},\n  \"Prosody\": {\"score\": 2, \"comment\": \"Prosody is not well-executed. The frequent use of L-L% at phrase boundaries indicates a lack of variety in intonation and the presence of downstepping and the frequent use of !H* suggests unnatural emphasis and emphasis placement.\"},\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The TextGrid shows several features that contribute to the assessment. \\n\\n*   **Accuracy:** The presence of !H* at 4.87, 9.934999999999999, 13.254999999999999, and 14.129999999999999 suggests either mispronunciations or misplaced emphasis. These forced high pitches might indicate that stress is being placed on incorrect syllables or words, detracting from the naturalness of the speech and thus affecting accuracy.\\n\\n*   **Fluency:** The 'breaks' tier indicates the pauses between words and phrases. Most are level 1, representing the weakest boundary. The presence of levels 3 and 4 at times (e.g., 1.31, 2.85, 5.19) shows noticeable pauses, which impact fluency. The concentration of levels 3/4 boundaries implies potential disfluencies in the reading. Also, the break indices from the 'breaks' tier contain odd placements such as 9.665 (L*) and 9.6 where breaks 1 and 1 follow each other and 9.69 (1) follow each other with no sounds in between.\\n\\n*   **Prosody:** The frequent use of L-L% boundary tones (5.19, 8.42, 10.13, 11.57, 12.3, 14.92, 16.08) signals a consistent falling intonation at the end of phrases, which, while grammatically correct, indicates a monotonous delivery with little pitch variance. Additionally, the combination of !H* and L-L% further accentuates the unnatural emphasis and flat intonation. The H* and L* tones are not varied or used to effectively convey meaning, leading to a low prosody score. The presence of HL- and LL- also indicate downstepping that negatively affects intonation.\"\n}\n```"
